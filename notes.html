		<h2><a href="https://github.com/kangqiyu/Manifold">Differential Geometry</a> </h2>
		<p>
			This note is about Differential Geometry. In this note, we provide a basic introduction for researchers unfamiliar with this topic. Recently, in the deep neural networks (DNNs) community, embedding features onto arbitrary learnable (pseudo-)Riemannian or symplectic manifolds has boosted representation learning. Differential Geometry is also the proper mathematical language for classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and statistical physics. In the Graph Neural Networks (GNN) community, bringing geometrical or physical inspirations to design new learnable graph model have also gained increasing attention.

			<h2><a href="https://github.com/kangqiyu/Algebra">Abstract Algebra</a></h2>
			<p>
				This note is about Abstract Algebra. Bringing symmetry to neural networks has been studied in some works. We provide a basic introduction to this area.

			<h2><a href="https://github.com/kangqiyu/ODE-Theory">Ordinary Differential Equation Theory</a> </h2>
			<p>
				This note is about Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Theory. It contains the standard conditions for the existence and uniqueness of ODE solutions. The continuity and differentiability dependence of the solutions on initial conditions and parameters are explained. Various stability concepts are introduced.
