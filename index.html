				<!-- I am exploring a new paradigm in machine learning that integrates principles of physics dynamics and mathematics, aiming to address some of the pressing challenges in artificial intelligence, such as effectiveness, interpretability, and robustness. My current work focuses on three significant areas: the complexity of neural network design, the vulnerability of neural networks to perturbations, and the practical validation of this emerging paradigm. Through my research on <span style="color: #607D8B;">dynamics-driven continuous graph neural networks</span>, <span style="color: #607D8B;">dynamics-guided robust neural networks</span>, and <span style="color: #607D8B;">perception-decision practices</span>, I have had the opportunity to contribute to both theoretical insights and practical applications. Looking ahead, I am eager to further enhance our understanding of this innovative machine learning paradigm and explore its potential to transform the landscape of artificial intelligence. -->
